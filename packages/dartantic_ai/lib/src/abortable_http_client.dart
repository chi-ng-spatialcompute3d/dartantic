/// An [http.Client] that wraps an inner client and exposes a single
/// [abort] method to cancel the currently in-flight request.
///
/// Designed for turn-based usage where at most one request is in flight
/// at a time. Each [send] creates a fresh abort trigger and a fresh
/// abortable request, so aborting one turn does not affect the next.
///
/// Supports all standard [http.BaseRequest] subtypes:
/// - [http.Request]                  → [http.AbortableRequest]
/// - [http.StreamedRequest]          → [http.AbortableStreamedRequest]
/// - [http.MultipartRequest]         → [http.AbortableMultipartRequest]
///
/// Any other request subtype throws [UnsupportedError]. This is
/// deliberate: silently dropping the abort trigger would produce a
/// request that looks abortable but isn't.
///
/// The [abortTrigger] is only honored if the inner client supports
/// aborting requests. `IOClient` and `RetryClient` do; some clients
/// (e.g. `BrowserClient`) may not.
///
/// ## Combining abort with retry
///
/// To get both abort and retry, compose this client with
/// `package:http`'s [RetryClient]. **Abort must be the outer layer**
/// so that `RetryClient` never sees the abort as a failure it should
/// retry:
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
/// import 'package:http/retry.dart';
///
/// final client = AbortHttpClient(
///   inner: RetryClient(
///     http.Client(),
///     retries: 3,
///     when: (response) => response.statusCode == 429,
///   ),
///   name: 'gemini',
/// );
///
/// // To abort the current turn:
/// client.abort();
///
/// // When done with the client entirely:
/// client.close();
/// ```
///
/// `RetryClient` explicitly recognizes `RequestAbortedException` and
/// will not retry an aborted request, so the outer abort layer is
/// sufficient to guarantee prompt cancellation.
///
/// ## Ownership of [inner]
///
/// - If [inner] is **omitted**, a default `http.Client()` is created
///   internally and this client owns it.
/// - If [inner] is **provided**, ownership depends on [transferInner]:
///   - When [transferInner] is `null` (default), the caller retains
///     ownership. This client will not close [inner].
///   - When [transferInner] is `true`, ownership is transferred to
///     this client. [close] will close [inner], and the caller must
///     not use it afterward.
class AbortHttpClient extends http.BaseClient {
  /// Creates a new [AbortHttpClient].
  ///
  /// [inner] is the client that performs the actual HTTP work. If
  /// omitted, a default `http.Client()` is created and owned by this
  /// instance.
  ///
  /// [transferInner] controls whether [close] will close [inner].
  /// - `null` (default): ownership is inferred. This client owns
  ///   [inner] only if it created it (i.e. `inner == null`). A
  ///   caller-provided [inner] is left untouched by [close].
  /// - `true`: ownership is transferred to this client, which will
  ///   close [inner] on [close]. The caller must not use [inner]
  ///   after calling [close].
  /// - `false`: this client will never close [inner], even if it
  ///   created it. Only meaningful when [inner] is omitted; useful
  ///   for cases where the default client should outlive this wrapper.
  ///
  /// [name] is used only for diagnostics.
